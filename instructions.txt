Update password to something meeting requirement

Go to My account --> Security and Generate Token ... I tried Global Analysis Token

We need the token for the sonar-project.properties file

Hehe it's telling me adding the secret directly is bad code ... Cool~

Download sonar-scanner and add to PATH... for me it was just brew install

Then go to project root.. where sonar-project.properties is kept and run the command..

sonar-scanner

Finally, go to localhost:9000 to view the report
